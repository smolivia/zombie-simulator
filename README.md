Dennis Cosgrove (http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~cosgroved/) is the author of supporting files ArgsProcessor, Timing, and ZombieSimulationFiles as well as select methods indicated by comments in the code.

This program runs files from the provided ZombieSimulationFiles to simulate how infection spreads with zombies and non-zombies intelligently reacting to each others presence. There is also a chance that an infected non-zombie will be consumed and disappear entirely. The files provide the starting coordinates of all zombies and non-zombies. Zombies and non-zombies are both repesented by Entity objects written in a separate java file.
